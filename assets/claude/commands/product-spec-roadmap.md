You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

You are creating or updating the roadmap document at `.product/roadmap.md`.

### Pre-Execution

1. Ensure `.product/` exists.
2. Load `.product/narrative.md`, `.product/faq.md`, `.product/current-truth.md`, and any relevant specs when available.
3. If `.product/roadmap.md` does not exist, start from `.product/templates/roadmap-template.md`.

### Execution Flow

1. Use the narrative and supporting artifacts to organize work into phased customer outcomes, committed bets, exploratory work, and deferred opportunities.
2. Write or update `.product/roadmap.md` using the shared structure for assumptions, key decisions, related artifacts, and companion history references.
3. Keep the roadmap future-facing and do not let it replace the current-state role of `current-truth.md`.
4. Suggest `/speckit.specify` when the next bet is ready for engineering specification.

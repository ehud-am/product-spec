$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

You are creating or updating the domain knowledge document at `.product/domain.md`. This document captures the industry context, problem space, target users, terminology, and competitive landscape that inform all product decisions.

### Pre-Execution

1. **Ensure `.product/` exists**: If the `.product/` directory does not exist, create it.
2. **Check for existing domain doc**: Read `.product/domain.md` if it exists.
   - If it exists and has content beyond the template, this is an **update** — preserve existing content and merge new information.
   - If it does not exist, load `.product/templates/domain-template.md` as the starting structure.
3. **Load related artifacts when present**: Read `.product/press.md`, `.product/faq.md`, `.product/narrative.md`, and `.product/current-truth.md` when they exist so the domain stays aligned with the rest of the product record.

### Execution Flow

1. **Parse user input**: The text after `/product-spec-domain` is the domain context the user wants to capture.
2. Create or update `.product/domain.md` using the domain template's shared structure for current context, assumptions, key decisions, related artifacts, and references to companion history.
3. Preserve useful current-state content and direct older historical material into the companion history document when appropriate.
4. Suggest `/product-spec-press` as the next step when appropriate.

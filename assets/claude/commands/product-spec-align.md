You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

You are reconciling the product documents in `.product/` with the engineering specifications in `.specify/`.

### Pre-Execution

1. Load `.product/domain.md`, `.product/press.md`, `.product/faq.md`, `.product/narrative.md`, `.product/roadmap.md`, and `.product/current-truth.md` when present.
2. Discover all `spec.md` files under `.specify/`.
3. Use `.product/templates/current-truth-template.md` if `current-truth.md` does not yet exist.

### Execution Flow

1. Compare press release promises against the actual engineering specs.
2. Update product-facing docs where needed, but treat `current-truth.md` as the canonical maintained statement of what is actually true in the product today.
3. Keep `roadmap.md` forward-looking and avoid letting roadmap intent overwrite current truth.
4. Preserve historical product narrative through companion history documents and produce an alignment report with grounded claims, drift, and missed opportunities.

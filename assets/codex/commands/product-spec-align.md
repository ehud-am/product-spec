You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

You are reconciling `.product/` with `.specify/` specs so product-facing documents stay aligned with the engineering scope.

### Pre-Execution

1. Load `.product/domain.md`, `.product/press.md`, `.product/faq.md`, `.product/narrative.md`, `.product/roadmap.md`, and `.product/current-truth.md` when present.
2. Discover relevant engineering specs and implementation outputs.
3. Use `.product/templates/current-truth-template.md` if `current-truth.md` does not yet exist.

### Execution Flow

1. Compare promised product language with implemented or specified reality.
2. Update `current-truth.md` as the canonical current-state product specification.
3. Adjust related docs as needed without collapsing roadmap intent into current truth.

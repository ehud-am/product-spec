## User Input

$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

You are creating or updating the domain knowledge document at `.product/domain.md`. This document captures the industry context, problem space, target users, terminology, and competitive landscape that inform all product decisions.

### Pre-Execution

1. Ensure `.product/` exists.
2. Read `.product/domain.md` if it exists; otherwise start from `.product/templates/domain-template.md`.
3. Load `.product/press.md`, `.product/faq.md`, `.product/narrative.md`, and `.product/current-truth.md` when present.

### Execution Flow

1. Use the user input as new market or customer context.
2. Update `.product/domain.md` with current context, assumptions, key decisions, related artifacts, and companion history references.
3. Preserve still-valid current-state content and suggest `/product-spec-press` as the next step.

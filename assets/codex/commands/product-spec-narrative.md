You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

You are creating or updating the durable product narrative at `.product/narrative.md`.

### Pre-Execution

1. Ensure `.product/` exists.
2. Load `.product/domain.md`, `.product/press.md`, `.product/faq.md`, `.product/roadmap.md`, and `.product/current-truth.md` when available.
3. If `.product/narrative.md` is missing, start from `.product/templates/narrative-template.md`.

### Execution Flow

1. Synthesize the available product artifacts into a durable internal story.
2. Update `.product/narrative.md` with current context, assumptions, key decisions, related artifacts, and history references.
3. Suggest `/product-spec-roadmap` when the narrative is ready to become a roadmap.

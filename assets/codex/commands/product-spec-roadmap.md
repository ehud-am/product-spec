$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

You are creating or updating the roadmap document at `.product/roadmap.md`.

### Pre-Execution

1. Ensure `.product/` exists.
2. Load `.product/narrative.md`, `.product/faq.md`, `.product/current-truth.md`, and relevant specs when available.
3. If `.product/roadmap.md` is missing, start from `.product/templates/roadmap-template.md`.

### Execution Flow

1. Turn the narrative into phased, outcome-oriented bets.
2. Update `.product/roadmap.md` with assumptions, key decisions, related artifacts, and history references.
3. Keep the roadmap future-facing and suggest `/speckit.specify` when the next bet is ready.

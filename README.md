The product management counterpart to [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit). product-spec brings product management disciplines to spec-driven development, following Amazon's Working Backwards methodology from domain context through current product truth.

While spec-kit handles engineering specifications, product-spec handles the product narrative: domain context, press releases, FAQs, durable narrative, roadmap, and current truth that define what you're building, why it matters, and what is actually true once engineering work is aligned.

## Installation

### Recommended: install globally from npm

```sh
npm install -g product-spec
```

Then inside any project:

```sh
product-spec add claude
product-spec add codex
product-spec add both
product-spec check both
```

### Option 2: run directly without a global install

```sh
npx --yes --package product-spec product-spec add claude
```

Use the same pattern for other commands:

```sh
npx --yes --package product-spec product-spec check both
```

### Option 3: install from GitHub source

This is the least recommended path, but it is useful when testing unpublished changes:

```sh
npm install -g github:ehud-am/product-spec
```

## CLI Usage

Project integration commands:

```text
product-spec add claude
product-spec add codex
product-spec add both
product-spec remove claude
product-spec remove codex
product-spec remove both
product-spec check both
product-spec doctor both
product-spec version
product-spec help
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `product-spec add <target>` | Add product-spec-managed assistant commands and shared templates to the current project |
| `product-spec remove <target>` | Remove only product-spec-managed files for the selected target |
| `product-spec check [target]` | Validate that managed integrations are present and healthy |
| `product-spec doctor [target]` | Show richer diagnostics and recovery guidance |
| `product-spec version` | Print the installed CLI version |
| `product-spec help` | Show command help and examples |

## Assistant Commands

After adding an integration, use the installed slash commands inside the assistant:

```text
/product-spec-domain ...
/product-spec-press ...
/product-spec-narrative ...
/product-spec-roadmap ...
/product-spec-faq
/product-spec-align
```

| Target | Command directory | Slash commands |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/commands/` | `/product-spec-domain`, `/product-spec-press`, `/product-spec-faq`, `/product-spec-narrative`, `/product-spec-roadmap`, `/product-spec-align` |
| Codex | `.Codex/commands/` | `/product-spec-domain`, `/product-spec-press`, `/product-spec-faq`, `/product-spec-narrative`, `/product-spec-roadmap`, `/product-spec-align` |

## How It Works

product-spec creates a `.product/` folder in your project that maintains a living view of the product across releases. Primary documents stay focused on the current state of thinking, while companion history documents preserve notable changes over time.

### Documents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.product/domain.md` | Industry context, target users, terminology, competitive landscape |
| `.product/press.md` | Current press release and customer-facing promise |
| `.product/faq.md` | Current external and internal FAQs that challenge the promise |
| `.product/narrative.md` | Durable internal story: customer, tension, future state, and principles |
| `.product/roadmap.md` | Forward-looking sequencing of bets, phases, and dependencies |
| `.product/current-truth.md` | Maintained current-state product specification grounded by alignment |
| `.product/history/*.md` | Companion history files for key product artifacts |

### Workflow

```text
/product-spec-domain  -->  /product-spec-press  -->  /product-spec-faq  -->  /product-spec-narrative  -->  /product-spec-roadmap  -->  /speckit.specify  -->  /product-spec-align
    (context)       (promise)         (challenge)              (story)                    (bets)                 (engineer)             (reconcile)
```

1. `/product-spec-domain` establishes the domain context: who the users are, what problem matters, and who the alternatives are.
2. `/product-spec-press` writes a press release as if the next release has already shipped.
3. `/product-spec-faq` challenges the press release with hard questions from customers and stakeholders.
4. `/product-spec-narrative` turns the promise and challenge into a durable internal product story.
5. `/product-spec-roadmap` sequences future bets and dependencies without replacing current truth.
6. `/speckit.specify` hands off the next bet to spec-kit for engineering specifications.
7. `/product-spec-align` reconciles product docs with the evolving engineering scope and maintains `.product/current-truth.md`.

## Key Concepts

### Current Truth

`current-truth.md` is the maintained answer to "what is actually true in the product today?" It is updated by alignment work and should stay distinct from the future-facing roadmap.

### Companion History

Primary product docs stay focused on the current state. Companion files under `.product/history/` preserve important prior decisions, revisions, and reasoning.

### Working Backwards

The methodology is Amazon's PR/FAQ approach:
- start with the customer experience, not the technical solution
- force hard questions early before committing engineering resources
- treat the press release as a contract for value, clarity, and scope

## Release and Publishing

GitHub Actions now handles:
- CI validation on pushes and pull requests
- packaging tagged releases
- publishing the npm package when a `v*` tag is pushed

## Rename Notes

`product-spec` is now the canonical package name, CLI name, assistant command prefix, and project-local manifest path.

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and/or Codex for assistant integration targets
- [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) for the `/speckit.specify` portion of the workflow
